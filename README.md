# The Study of the Spatial Accessibility of Health Care Centers for the Population Below Poverty and the Elderly over 65 in Connecticut
## -- Using Buffer and Network Analyst in ArcGIS Pro

## Introduction
The report analyzes the geographic relationship between medical service centers and residents in Connecticut through two methods. The method uses buffer and network to analyze the distribution of residents 1-mile from the medical service center. Compare the results of these two analyses and evaluate whether the geographic distribution of Connecticutâ€™s medical service providers is effective in serving residents. The study purpose of the report is to analyze and evaluate the spatial accessibility of people below the poverty line. The map specifically introduces and visualizes the population below the poverty line in Connecticut, as well as the spatial accessibility of medical facilities to the elderly over 65. In the study, I got two analysis methods in the research, and found that the analysis of the two methods of buffer and network play different roles, and they have different advantages and disadvantages. It will be introduced later in the report. In addition, I understand the importance of how to do geographic analysis in the real world through ArcGIS Pro.
